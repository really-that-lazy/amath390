Though spectral domain techniques have been proposed,

statisticians are more likely to rely on "nearest-neighbor"

distributions, i.e., the distribution of points relative to a typical point. Several nearest-neighbor measures are ex-tremely useful to halftoning, and in this paper we show

two such spatial-statistic metrics which can be very useful in characterizing halftone patterns. We begin with a more

pattern can represent, SFC diffuses quantization error from one cluster to the next. The result is a technique which

combines the benefits of aperiodic structure with those of

clustered dots.

Scheermesser's and Bryngdahl's technique attempts to

minimize the cost associated with a particular arrangement

of dots by iteratively turning pixels "on" and "off." The

cost associated with a particular arrangement of dots is

determined by two factors. The first is an image met-

ric which measures the difference between the perceived

images of the binary halftone pattern and the continuous

tone original. The second cost is a numerical texture

metric which measures the relative orientation of minority

pixels. Scheermesser's and Bryngdahl's technique is able

to produce adjustable coarseness by adjusting the weight of the cost of the texture metric versus the perceived image

metric.

There are, of course, many other algorithms which pro-

duce stochastic arrangements of minority pixel clusters

(green noise). The reason that this paper chooses to look at Levien's technique is because it is ideally suited, based so much on Floyd's and Steinberg's original error-diffusion

algorithm [16], to present an evolution of the blue-noise

model originally described by Ulichney [12]-having, like

with output-dependent feedback creates patterns which may

be described as "good" green-noise patterns, i.e., exhibiting sharp peaks in both the spectral

In the following sections, we look at some variations to error diffusion with output-dependent feedback and compare

following.

DOT GAIN

As stated in the introduction, dot gain is the increase

in size of the printed dot relative to the intended size, and whether a function of the mechanical printing process or the optical properties of paper, dot gain is present in all printing processes. Therefore, it cannot be eliminated. Assuming

that the process is repeatable, dot gain can be anticipated and controlled [7], but in printing processes which are not repeatable [7], compensating for dot gain is a far more

difficult task. In these instances, it may be more desirable to use a scheme which resists dot gain, thereby making

the printed output more robust to variations in the printing process. An example where dot gain is anticipated and

therefore compensated for is Pappas' and Neuhoff's [19]

modified error-diffusion algorithm employing a circular

dot-overlap model which models printed dots as round dots

which overlap neighboring pixels, thereby causing printed

halftones to appear darker than the original fraction of ones.

Although for many printers the circular dot-overlap

model is invalid [20], it illustrates an important aspect

of dot gain with regards to digital halftoning. That being

the relationship between dot gain and the perimeter-to-area (b)

ratio of printed dots with higher ratios leading to higher

average dot gain. In dispersed dot halftones (FM), this ratio Fig. 25.

Fig. 30 shows a comparison of five major classes of

writes that blue noise is pleasant because it does not add

a structure of its own to an image as do dispersed-order

dither and clustered-dot dither, both being arranged to form a regular pattern. Blue noise also does not look too "noisy"

conditions are not ideal, printing distortions such as dot-

noise preferable to blue.

In closing, we add that the impact of blue noise on digital halftoning has been wide spread and has triggered many

advancements. In particular, the blue-noise mask [21] has

greatly decreased the computational complexity of dithering with blue noise. Equivalent developments can be made for

green noise, as is noted in [22] for the green-noise mask.
