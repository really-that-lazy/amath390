We have constructed two highly stable and reproducible 87Rb D 2-saturated-absorption spectrometers at 780 nm, using dither/third-harmonic lock-in detection and radio-frequency sideband techniques, respectively.

We achieved 63-kHz reproducibility and agreement between these two independent systems.

Extrapolating to zero power results in a measured

linewidth in both spectrometers of ,7 MHz, compared

with ,6-MHz natural linewidth. This extra 1 MHz

includes all experimental parameters and in part is

due to vibration of the laser prestabilizing reference

cavities as well as to any possible gas contamination

in the cell. Various cells placed in one spectrometer

produced frequency shifts of less than a few kilohertz.

It is satisfying that the lasers are locked with an

5 P 3/2 state were determined with precision improved by

a factor of 10. We expect to realize inexpensive, com-
