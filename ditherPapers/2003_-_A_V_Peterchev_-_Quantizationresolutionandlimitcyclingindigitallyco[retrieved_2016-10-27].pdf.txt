in steady state when the DPWM resolution is less than

the ADC resolution, and there is no DPWM level that maps

into the ADC bin corresponding to the reference voltage

(this ADC bin will be referred to as the zero-error bin). In steady state, the controller will be attempting to drive

to

the zero-error bin, however due to the lack of a DPWM level

there, it will alternate between the DPWM levels around the

zero-error bin. This results in nonequilibrium behavior, such as steady-state limit cycling.

The first step toward eliminating limit cycles is to ensure that under all circumstances there is a DPWM level that maps into

the zero-error bin. This can be guaranteed if the resolution of (a)

the DPWM module is finer than the resolution of the ADC. A

one-bit difference in the resolutions,

sufficient in most applications since it provides two DPWM

levels per one ADC level

IV. CONTROLLED DIGITAL DITHER

The precision with which a digital controller regulates

can be regulated with a tolerance of one

of the ADC.

Many present-day applications, such as microprocessor VRMs,

demand regulation precision of about 10 mV [8], requiring ADCs and DPWM modules with very high resolution. For example,

patterns of any shape, and can therefore implement minimum-ripple dither such as the one in Table I(b). A look-up table stores dither sequences, each

D. Dither Ripple Size

In Section IV-A it was shown that the longer the dither pat-

terns used, the larger the effective DPWM resolution. However, longer dither patterns can cause higher output ripple, since they contain lower frequency components, and the

filter has less

attenuation at lower frequencies. This consideration puts a practical limit on the number of bits of dither that can be added to increase the resolution of the DPWM module.
