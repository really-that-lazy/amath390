goals can be achieved by selecting the inverter switching states

according to the errors of torque and flux.

Therefore the main theme of direct torque control is to regu-

late the torque and magnitude of flux directly without invoking

any concept of field orientation. Following this essential con-

cept, Fig. 5 shows the block diagram of the new DTC-based

induction motor drives. As shown in Fig. 5, two proportional-

integral (PI) type controllers regulate the flux amplitude and

torque, respectively. Therefore, both the torque and the mag-

nitude of flux are under control, thereby generating the voltage

command for inverter control. Noting that no decoupling mech-

anism is required since the flux magnitude and torque can be

regulated by the PI controllers. Experimental results derived

from a test induction motor drive will be given later in this paper

to strongly support this point of view.

As shown in Fig. 5, the inverter is controlled by the SVM

technique [16], [24] using Symmetrical Regular-Sampling technique [18]. Therefore, the inverter switching frequency is significantly increased, and the associated torque ripple and current

to this fact, the inverter switching frequency is less than that of

It is well known that both switching losses and sampling fre-

quency of controller of drives limit the inverter switching fre-

quency. The discussion about these two topics and the related

solutions can be found in [20]-[22]. Since the inverter switching frequency for conventional DTC schemes depends upon the hys-teresis band and is not constant, the experimental results for

comparisons are conducted based upon the same sampling fre-

quency of controller of drives.
